# Advent of Code 2021 - Java solutions

These are my solutions to the Advent of Code challenge in 2021.

This is not clean code, with minimal packaging, just to get the job done. Exceptions are not really handled, as the AoC input is always valid (unless the exercise specifically states that it is not.)
I will create a new class for each day, with a simple `Runnable` as base class.

The challenge can be found at: https://adventofcode.com/2021

Happy Coding!
